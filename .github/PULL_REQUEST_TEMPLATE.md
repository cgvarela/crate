<!--

Thank you for your contribution. Here is a quick checklist of things you should've done:

 - You've read CONTRIBUTING.rst and signed our CLA (https://crate.io/community/contribute/cla/)
 - Wrote a CHANGES.txt entry if this is a change that is relevant for users of CrateDB
 - Run tests with `./gradlew test itest` (If they fail Jenkins will block this PR anyway)
